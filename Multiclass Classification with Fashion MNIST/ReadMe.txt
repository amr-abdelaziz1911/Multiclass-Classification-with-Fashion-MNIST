## Multiclass Classification with Fashion MNIST

# Objective
This project aims to classify images of fashion items into one of ten categories using a neural network built with Keras and TensorFlow. The network is trained to recognize different types of clothing and accessories from the Fashion MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy on unseen test data.

# Dataset Description
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items from 10 categories, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and each label represents one of the following classes:

1-T-shirt/top
2-Trouser
3-Pullover
4-Dress
5-Coat
6-Sandal
7-Shirt
8-Sneaker
9-Bag
10-Ankle boot
